Sarepta Therapeutics: The Hidden Hero of Healthcare

Executive Summary 

 

Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) currently has a share price that is unjustifiably undervalued relative to its long-term potential and role in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy treatment. While investing is a practice centered on speculation and deductive reasoning, at times, valuation requires little speculation when a company’s role to its industry and its patients goes unrecognized.  

Sarepta’s assets consist of therapies for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). As the first biotechnology company to develop a drug to aid DMD patients, Sarepta has cemented itself in the pharmaceutical industry through a pipeline of gene therapy and PMO (phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer) exon-skipping therapies, along with several new therapies currently in development. Sarepta’s relevance in the DMD market is unlike any other, targeting an underrepresented group of patients in the healthcare industry. 

In recent months, Sarepta has faced multiple challenges involving management blunders as well as patient deaths leading to scrutiny from both the FDA and several legal firms. Following each event, this scrutiny, along with pressure from pessimistic retail and institutional investors has caused Sarepta’s share price to decline significantly from a year-to-date high of $127.89 on 1/6/25 to $16.97 on 6/23/25, along with institutional price targets for the company.  The irrational, fear-driven overreaction of several of Sarepta’s shareholders has led to a current valuation that does not accurately reflect Sarepta’s earning potential and current role in DMD treatment. 

This analysis will prove that Sarepta’s current stock price is a misrepresentation of the company’s value, and how Sarepta can be an opportunity for keen investors. 

 

Background 

 

What is DMD? Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and deterioration. This is caused by a lack of dystrophin protein due to mutations in the DMD gene. As time has progressed, the life expectancy of DMD patients has increased to the 30’s and 40’s, but most patients, historically, did not live past their teenage years (Muscular Dystrophy Association). 

It was not until September of 2016 that Sarepta’s exon-skipping therapy for DMD was approved by the FDA. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy had no known effective therapies until 1974, when it was discovered that corticosteroids were a viable option that prolonged muscle function and quality of life (Sujatha Gurunathan). However, the usage of corticosteroids like prednisone or Deflazacort in DMD patients was found to cause side effects like bone deterioration, high blood pressure, and behavioral changes (“Steroids: The Pros and Cons | AUSNMD”). Steroids were not a great solution for DMD patients and their families, but they were the only option before the approval of Sarepta’s exon-skipping drugs.  

In 1977, exon-skipping and RNA splicing was discovered, and nearly 4 decades later in 2016, Sarepta’s drug, Exondys 51 (eteplirsen), was approved by the FDA (Lim and Yokota). As the first approved DMD treatment of its kind, this drug marked the beginning of Sarepta’s dominance in the DMD treatment industry. In 2019, the FDA approved Vyondys 53 (golodirsen) which served to treat up to 8% of the DMD population (Sarepta PR, 2019). In 2021, the FDA approved Amondys 45 (casimersen) which, like Vyondys 53, served to treat up to 8% of the DMD population. At this point, Sarepta’s market was nearly 30 percent of the total DMD population (Sarepta PR, 2021). Sarepta went on to develop the world’s first approved gene therapy treatment for DMD, Elevidys, which was approved by the FDA in 2023 (Sarepta PR, 2023). 

As of today, these are all four of Sarepta’s approved therapies, with several others in development. 

 

Financial Overview and Share Price Catalysts 

 

Sarepta reported $611.5 million in revenue for Q1 of 2025, a 70% YoY increase from Q1 of 2024, $375 million of which being from Elevidys sales. In 2024, Sarepta’s PMO drugs (Exondys 51, Vyondys 53, and Amondys 45) generated $967.2 million in revenue, while their gene therapy drug, Elevidys, generated 820.8M in revenue (Sarepta PR, 2025).   

As a rule of thumb for valuations of rare disease therapies, a 4x enterprise value to revenue multiple would typically be utilized to estimate the enterprise value of Sarepta’s drugs.  

Taking a slightly more conservative approach to determining the PMO drug line’s value with an EV/revenue multiple of 3.5x based on their revenue of $967.2 million in 2024, we get a value of ~$2.9 billion.  

With Elevidys, rather than using the 3.5x enterprise value to revenue multiple, to compensate for ongoing investigations and investor skepticism, we can use a slightly more bearish multiple of 2x based on $820.8 million in revenue, giving us a value of ~$1.64 billion. 

Using an estimated enterprise value of $2.9 billion for the PMO drugs and $1.64 billion for Elevidys, we can justify an enterprise value of $4.54 billion for Sarepta’s commercial drugs alone.    

Asides from Sarepta’s gene therapy and PMO line of drugs, Sarepta has a ~$640 million net cash position with ~$2.43 billion in liabilities and ~$3.07 billion in current assets (Sarepta Therapeutics). 

While an estimated value of $4.54 billion is a good start for determining the enterprise value of Sarepta, there are key strategic advantages and developments that add value on top of Sarepta’s current commercial products. 

 Sarepta has a partnership with Roche, which broadens their marketability to a global scale and provides them with an additional source of revenue through royalties of SRP-9001 (Sarepta PR, Roche partnership). 

Sarepta is also currently developing multiple limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) therapies, which has currently no approved treatments, SRP-9003, SRP-9004, and SRP-9005 (Sarepta PR, Pipeline Progress for Multiple Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Programs). This accounts for the significant surge in R&D costs for Q1 of 2025 which nearly matched their R&D expenses for all of 2024. 

At Sarepta’s current price of 18.22 as of 6/6/25 with 98.28M shares outstanding, Sarepta’s market cap is $1.79 billion. If Sarepta’s commercial products alone are worth $4.54 billion using a conservative EV/revenue multiple, how could their market cap possibly be less than half of that value? What is being priced in that has caused Sarepta’s share price to drop to such a critical level? 

 

 

Sarepta’s current market cap is being influenced by investors who are pricing in a worst-case scenario for the company regarding regulations, a loss of pipeline, as well as reputation damage. 

Sarepta began to face scrutiny from the FDA after the deaths of two non-ambulatory Elevidys patients. This sparked a series of investigations regarding Elevidys’ safety in non-ambulatory patients even though it had already been approved. This has also led to class-action lawsuits on behalf of investors who claimed that Sarepta had made misleading claims about Elevidys’ safety (Fox Business). 

Additionally, Sarepta had a poor earnings report for Q1 of 2025, as a drastic increase in R&D spending on their limb-girdle programs led to a lower-than-expected performance. Investors are pricing in the possibility that the programs may prove to be unsuccessful, and in turn, further damage the reputation of the company.  
 
 

 

Conclusion 

Despite media criticism, regulatory concerns, and class action lawsuits, Sarepta still generates substantial revenue through therapies for DMD patients. Based on Sarepta’s commercial products’ revenue in 2024, a reasonable estimated enterprise value of their products alone is 4.54B, a sharp contrast to the current market cap of only 1.79B. Even in an extreme case where Elevidys is taken off the market due to safety concerns, Sarepta’s PMO products would give their commercial products alone an enterprise value of at least 2.9B. This means that even without one of Sarepta’s primary sources of revenue, the value of Sarepta’s assets will still exceed its current market cap. 

The current price does not accurately represent what Sarepta is worth, as investors seem to be pricing in a complete collapse of Sarepta’s reputation, current products, and developments. However, for the keen investor who can see past the fear and media noise, a rare opportunity to acquire a biotech leader is offered at the current share price.
